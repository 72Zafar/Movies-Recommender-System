Key Features:
Content-Based Filtering: This approach recommends movies by comparing the similarity between the movie's metadata (e.g., genres, actors, directors) and the userâ€™s past preferences. It analyzes the characteristics of movies that a user has liked in the past to find similar movies.

Collaborative Filtering: By examining user interactions, such as ratings and watch history, the system predicts the preferences of users by finding patterns among similar user groups. This method helps to recommend movies that users with similar tastes have enjoyed.

Hybrid Model: The recommender system combines content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to provide more accurate and diverse recommendations. This hybrid approach balances the benefits of both methods, enhancing the overall user experience.

Scalability and Performance: Built using Python and popular libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Numpy, the system efficiently handles large datasets. It can be further scaled using advanced techniques and platforms like Apache Spark or TensorFlow for real-time recommendations.

User-Friendly Interface: The system includes a simple, intuitive interface that allows users to receive recommendations with ease. Users can interact with the system by providing ratings, browsing suggestions, or searching for movies.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Surprise (for collaborative filtering)
Data Source: IMDb, TMDb, or other publicly available movie datasets
Evaluation Metrics: RMSE, MAE, Precision, and Recall to measure the effectiveness of recommendations
Future Enhancements:
Incorporate Deep Learning: Integrate neural network-based approaches like Autoencoders or Recurrent Neural Networks to capture complex patterns in user behavior.
Real-Time Recommendations: Implement real-time data processing to update recommendations as user preferences evolve.
Social Media Integration: Use data from social media platforms to refine and personalize recommendations further.
